# Steps to Follow

Here's an outline of the steps taken:

1. Create a Python Flask app (app.py)
2. Create a requirements file (requirements.txt)
3. Dockerise the Flask app to build an image (Dockerfile)
4. Set up a Jenkins server using Docker (port 8080)
5. Create a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy the Flask app (link the URL of GitHub repo in pipeline script from SCM)
6. Write a Bash script to manage the entire process (run.sh)
